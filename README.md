# Streaming-app-simulator
### OOP Assignments using Java for CPS 209

For this assignment, I created a simulation of a streaming app using basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java. The focus was on fundamental concepts such as ArrayLists, loops, and inheritance. Error handling and File IO were covered in the second assignment. Professor Tim McInerney provided skeleton code for most methods to assist with the project.
